Bambu claims that this will reduce remote attacks and exposures, and my thought, is in case if someone is stupid enough to open it via port forwarding. But people think it's a step ahead of squeezing the open ecosystem.</p> <ul> <li>Note that I am a proud owner of Bambu's A1 Mini 3D printer,  has two Voron printers (V2.3347 and V0.2378), but uses the normal Bambu Studio as it is ok to me. Other printers such as UltiMaker S3 and the 7-year old but short-lived idbox 3D printer that uses another slicer called UltiMaker Cura. And I am now designing a self-designed printer that is based of Voron Trident and FrankenVoron Tridex.</li> </ul>","tags":["reactions","ecosystem"]},{"location":"2025/01/21/bambu-ecosystem-squeezing-or-is-it/#before-this-lets-take-a-look-at-other-valid-controversies","title":"Before this, let's take a look at other, valid controversies","text":"<ul> <li>Bambu Lab sued by Stratasys with 8 patents, with half of them intended to troll Bambu and one of it being the same patent.

At least Bambu Lab recalled all pre-addressed A1 printers after two cases.</li> <li>New batches after recall has addressed bed wires that no longer cause unintended burns.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Decryptable printer log [addressed].<ul> <li>Bambu Lab's printer control software aren't using GPL-licensed software, like Klipper or Marlin. Even though for X1, Linux and the components are listed open-source.</li> <li>You should see why Bambu Lab started development of their first printer on September of 2020 and unveiled it 20 months later, while others \"copy\" within five months and put open-source software, don't you?</li> </ul> </li> <li>Thermal runaway test \"fail\" [addressed]<ul> <li>The ceramic heater can add resistance and resist generation under heat. For this in X1 and P1, the ceramic heater can heat up to around 400\u02daC before it no longer heats due to excessive resistance. Although it's still high, it's better than the standard heater cartridge where it can glow so insane that it melt the aluminum off.</li> <li>This was before any A-line printers release, but anyway, in A1 line of printers, and the future non-A-line printers that will use hotends for the A-line, they will predict if the hotend is present, and if it detects that the temperature rises up abnormally, it will stop heating.

This feature does not limit statistical interactions or starting a print job that's already on the card, among other things, but it limits control-related interactions and other critical operations. Users who do not want this feature can keep their firmware, but not if they received the printer with this firmware from start, cause this does not let them downgrade the firmware.</p>","tags":["reactions","ecosystem"]},{"location":"2025/01/21/bambu-ecosystem-squeezing-or-is-it/#why-did-it-became-controversal","title":"Why did it became controversal?","text":"<p>This has been fallen down to three sections, closing down the ecosystem, easy reverse engineering and dated terms.</p>","tags":["reactions","ecosystem"]},{"location":"2025/01/21/bambu-ecosystem-squeezing-or-is-it/#closing-down-the-ecosystem","title":"Closing down the ecosystem","text":"<p>This move has been known that it will affect community-maintained slicers, Home Assistant automations and dedicated controller devices (i.e. BTT Panda Touch). To address this, Bambu has unveiled a dedicated companion app called Bambu Connect that allows sending print jobs outside Bambu's own \"unmodified-by-community\" slicer and it's mobile companion app, and control the printer like on own slicer. I think not everyone likes this, as it adds three additional steps, and jogging the printhead will become cumbersome.</p> <p>People have said that this is a step ahead of becoming the HP (inkjet) printers in 3D (or of 3D printing), where they will not do anything, including scanning if one ink was empty, or beg for subscription. Or even worse, they will no longer support generic or third-party filaments, I myself included, which Bambu said they don't have intent on this or never; the other was over two years ago. At least my Canon paper printer does anything, even print, and even if the ink is empty. I can also use non-Canon cartridges to print on papers, even though losing exclusive features that can only be accessed on the Internet, but I have never tried it.</p>","tags":["reactions","ecosystem"]},{"location":"2025/01/21/bambu-ecosystem-squeezing-or-is-it/#easy-reverse-engineering","title":"Easy reverse engineering","text":"<p>Since Bambu Connect used Electron as it's base, and not using in-house encryption, people have figured out how to crack down the keys used by Bambu Connect, within a day of it's beta release.
